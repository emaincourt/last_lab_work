					h2 Acronym reveals new album, Malm, on Field Records
					p
						| A new album from Swedish techno and ambient artist Acronym is due out through Field Records in late October.

						|             Malm, Acronym's fourth LP and first for Field, is a ten-track release that he began working on in 2015. We're told it's an ambient-focused effort "informed by grief and sorrow," as the producer "pays homage to one of his lost friends." Field will issue the album on double-vinyl—in both black and limited light-blue wax—and digital formats.

						|             Since his first release on his own Dimensional Exploration label nearly five years ago, Acronym has become a key part of Abdulla Rashim and Varg's Northern Electronics crew, and his other endeavors include records on Svreca's Semantica and ASC's Auxiliary. He first appeared on Field with a track on the 2014 compilation Collection. Malm is the second LP project for the label this year, after Staffan Linzatti's The Dynamic Dispatch.
