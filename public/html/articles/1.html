        <h2>Sentiment Of Callousness is out in November, with the remix EP following in early 2018.</h2>
        <p>
            Berlin label SNTS's next release is an EP from experimental industrial duo OAKE called Sentiment Of Callousness. 
            
            Befitting of OAKE's dark aesthetic, we're told the new record "was written over a one-and-a-half-year period of total collapse, characterized by disconnection between the world within and the perception of the world outside." The resulting four tracks will land in early November. Then, at some point in early 2018, SNTS will put out Sentiment Of Callousness Remixed featuring Regis, Samuel Kerridge, Phase Fatale and label boss SNTS. A fifth rework, by UK producer Stephanie Sykes, will be available as a digital bonus. 
            
            Sentiment Of Callousness will be OAKE's first full vinyl release since Auferstehung, their 2014 album for Regis' Downwards outlet. (OAKE's last solo release was a contribution to Stroboscopic Artefacts' digital series, Monad, last year.) 
            
            Both OAKE and SNTS are also set to appear on the inaugural release from a new label, Research, in Novemberâ€”and before that, on Sunday, October 22nd, OAKE will be in London for Jaded at Corsica Studios.
